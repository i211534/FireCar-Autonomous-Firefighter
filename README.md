# FireCar: Autonomous Indoor Firefighting Robot

FireCar is an autonomous indoor firefighting robot designed for server rooms and data centers. It utilizes Raspberry Pi, embedded sensors, computer vision, and edge AI to detect, navigate to, and suppress fires in real time. Additionally, it provides live monitoring and alerts through a dedicated web application.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Fire Detection**: Leverages edge AI and computer vision to identify fire hazards.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Uses embedded sensors and AI algorithms for precise movement within indoor spaces.
- **Fire Suppression**: Equipped with mechanisms to actively suppress detected fires.
- **Live Monitoring and Alerts**: Offers a web application for real-time updates and notifications.

### Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi and embedded sensors for control and data acquisition.
- **Software**: Computer vision and edge AI for fire detection and navigation.
- **Web Application**: Live monitoring and alert system for remote supervision.

### Applications
- Server rooms
- Data centers
- Enclosed indoor environments requiring autonomous fire safety solutions
